# Stock Prediction

This repository contains a stock prediction project that utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices.

## Overview

The Stock Prediction project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and various machine learning algorithms. It employs techniques such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Data collection: The project collects historical stock data from reliable sources.
- Data preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
- Feature engineering: Relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed data, including technical indicators, sentiment analysis, and market trends.
- Model training: The project trains machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVM), random forests, or long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, using the prepared features.
- Model evaluation: The performance of the trained models is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
- Prediction: The trained models are used to make future stock price predictions based on unseen data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Required Python packages (specified in the `requirements.txt` file)

## Getting Started

To get started with the Stock Prediction project, follow these steps:(Open the terminal and follow these steps)

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ashu-tosh-singh/stock-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the folder using command:

>cd stock-prediction

3. Create the virtual environment using the command(if not previously created):

> py -m venv stockenv

4. Activate the virtual environment using the command:

>./stockenv/Scripts/activate

5. Instalk all the necessary packages using the command:

>pip install Django pandas scikit-learn

6. Now you will have to migrate to Virtual environment using the command:

>py manage.py migrate

7. Now you can run the server using the command:

>py manage.py runserver
